Crange is a tool to index and cross-reference C/C++ source code. It
can be used to generate tags database that can help with:

* Identifier definitions
* Identifier declaraions

The source metadata collected by Crange can help with building tools
to provide cross-referencing, syntax highlighting, code folding and
